# VRLandscapes
The VRLandcapes Webpage, where you view VRLandscapes.
## Developers
The VR is made using A-Frames, https://aframe.io, and to add your creation made with A-Frames,
1. Change the title to "VRLandscapes - Your Title Here", so the website is uniform.
2. Create a pull request.
3. Add your HTML file to the "scapes" folder, and a screenshot in the "shots" section of the "scapes" section.
4. Did you make sure the HTML file and the screenshot are named the same? An example would be "coolthing.html" and "coolthing.png".
5. In the index.html file in the "scapes" folder, add your VRLandscape in, like how everyone else did.
6. You are done!, now wait for me to confirm the pull request. Just wait a day.
7. Once I confirm it, finally, people can see your creation. Be happy.
